# GSM-AT-Command-Send-Receive
This GSM send and receive code was used in a research project on water availability in Pakistan. The project was funded by Higher Education Commision (HEC) Pakistan. The code is written in C and was programmed on Arduino UNO hardware which communicated with the SIM800C GSM module to send and receive data of water readings measured through a water flowmeter.
